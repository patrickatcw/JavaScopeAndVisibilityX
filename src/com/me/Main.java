directions;
- write a small program to read an integer from the keyboard using scanner and print out
the times table for that number, the table should run from 1 to 12
- you are allowed to use one variable called scanner for your scanner instance
- you can use as many other variables as you need, but they must all be called x,
which includes any class instances and loop control variables that you may decide
to use
- if you use a class, the class can be called X (capital), but any instances of it must
be called x (lower case)
- any methods you create must also be called x
- bonus;
change your program so that ALL  variables (including the scanner instance) are
called x
